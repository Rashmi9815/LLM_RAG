# LLM_RAG

This project focuses on the implementation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Large Language Models (LLMs). The primary objective is to enhance the capabilities of LLMs by integrating external knowledge sources, thereby improving the accuracy and relevance of generated responses.

## Introduction

Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text. However, they can sometimes produce information that is outdated or not entirely accurate. Retrieval-Augmented Generation addresses this limitation by incorporating external data sources into the generation process, ensuring that the outputs are both current and contextually relevant.

## Features

- **Integration with External Data Sources**: Enhances LLM responses by retrieving pertinent information from external databases or APIs.
- **Improved Response Accuracy**: Reduces the likelihood of generating outdated or incorrect information.
- **Dynamic Knowledge Updating**: Allows the model to access the most recent data without the need for retraining.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rashmi9815/LLM_RAG.git
   cd LLM_RAG
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Ensure you have [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *Note: The `requirements.txt` file should list all necessary dependencies for the project.*

## Usage

The primary code and implementation details are contained within the `LLM.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open `LLM.ipynb`**:

   Navigate to the notebook in the Jupyter interface and open it.

3. **Execute the Cells**:

   Follow the instructions within the notebook, executing each cell sequentially to understand and utilize the RAG system.
